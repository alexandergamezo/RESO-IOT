# Light Sensor Project

The solution consists of a console application for a light sensor and a server application implemented as a three-layer architecture.

To run the project:

1. Configure the parameters for the light sensor in the `Sensor/appsettings.json` file.
2. Configure the server application parameters in the `IOTDataProcessor/Properties/launchSettings.json` file.
3. Configure the database connection and JWT in the `Data/appsettings.json` file.
